This analysis seeks to identify regions across AZ which are boadly suitable for aquifer recharge projects as a general template for more focuse analysis.\nplain-language-summary: |\n  Identifying regions in AZ where surface water can be stored long-term as ground water.\nkey-points:\n  #| TBD\ndate: last-modified\nbibliography: references.bib\n#| citation:\n  #| container-title: Earth and Space Science\nnumber-sections: true\njupyter: python3\n---\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Introduction\n\n## Data & Methods {#sec-data-methods}\n### Elevation\nElevation and elevation derivatives from 30-m NASA SRTM. USGS 3-DEM (10m) product not suitable for full study area analysis due to (1) the large area of missing data in Mexico, and (2), the excessively high spatial resolution (massively increasing computational requirements).\n\nSRTM elevation sinks filled prior to calculating slope and aspect.\n\n**Should elevation be directly used in the suitability analysis?**\n\n## Conclusion {#sec-conclusions}\n\n## References {.unnumbered}\n\n",
