USGS 3-DEM (10m) product not suitable for full study area analysis due to (1) the large area of missing data in Mexico, and (2), the excessively high spatial resolution (massively increasing computational requirements).\n\nSRTM elevation sinks filled prior to calculating slope and aspect.\n\n**Should elevation be directly used in the suitability analysis?**\n\n#### Slope\nSlope derived from hydrologically conditioned (filled) 30-m SRTM layer using quadratic surface function and a fixed 30-m neighborhood.

However, the weighted importance of these layers is not uniform across space. Where the bedrock is close to the surface, we assume that the soil is the most important layer for ground water storage. Inversely, when the bedrock is extremely deep, we assume that the geology is the more important layer. Our soil layer is measured at a depth of 200cm (2m), and we assume a uniform soil depth across the state. Therefore, the depth to bedrock was divided by 200 to get a depth to bedrock (dtb) in soil units. The first \"soil depth\" was ascribed to the soil layer, and varies from 0 to 1, while the remaining \"soil depth\" were attibuted to the geology layer, with a range from 0 to 541. Ergo, where the bedrock is deepest, the geology layer is 541 time more influential than the soils layer.\n\n![Simple diagram of logic underlying the soil vs. subsurface geology weighting layers.](images/Depth_to_Bedrock/Notes.jpg)\n\nThese layers were created in a custom R script using the following raster math, with their resulting outputs.\n\n##### Soils\n```{{r}}\n# Where depth to bedrock (dtb) = 0cm, soil multiplier = 0 (no soil)\n# Where depth to dtb >= 200cm, soil multiplier = 1 (Full depth of soil)\n# Intermediate depths = linear\nsoilMultiplier = masked\nsoilMultiplier[soilMultiplier > 200] = 200  # Fix upper limit of soil depth = 200 cm\nsoilMultiplier = soilMultiplier/200\n```\n\n![Soils multipler layer.](images/Depth_to_Bedrock/SoilsMultiplier.png)\n\n##### Geology\n```{{r}}\n# Where dtb < 200cm, geology multiplier = 0 (soil only)\n# Where dtb >= 200cm, geology multiplier = dtb/200 (in units of relative soil depth)\ngeologyMultiplier = masked\ngeologyMultiplier[geologyMultiplier < 200] = 0\ngeologyMultiplier = geologyMultiplier/200\n```\n\n![Geology multiplier layer.](images/Depth_to_Bedrock/GeologyMultiplier.png)\n\n### Other Data Layers for Consideration\n\n#### Global Hydrologic Curve Number(GCN250)\nhttps://gee-community-catalog.org/projects/gcn250/?h=hydrologic\n\n> The GCN250 is a globally consistent, gridded dataset defining CNs at the **250 m spatial resolution** from new global land cover (300 m) and soils data (250 m). GCN250 **represents runoff** for a combination of the European space agency global land cover dataset for 2015 (ESA CCI-LC) resampled to 250 m and geo-registered with the hydrologic soil group global data product (HYSOGs250m) released in 2018. The **potential application** of this data includes **hydrologic design**, land management applications, flood risk assessment, and **groundwater recharge modeling**. The CN values vary depending on antecedent runoff conditions (ARC), which is affected by the rainfall intensity and duration, total rainfall, soil moisture conditions, cover density, stage of growth, and temperature[.] \n*emphasis mine*\n\n#### Soil Properties 800m\nhttps://gee-community-catalog.org/projects/soilprop/?h=\n\n> The data shown here were obtained by aggregating current USDA-NCSS soil survey data (SSURGO back-filled with STATSGO where SSURGO is not available) within **800m² grid cells**. This data aggregation technique results in maps that may not match the original data at any given point, and is **intended to depict regional trends in soil properties at the statewide scale**. \n*emphasis mine*\n\n* Pros:\n  + Lots of relevant data layers, such as:\n    - Avail. Water Holding Capacity\n    - Drainage Class\n    - Sat. Hyd. Conductivity \n    - Depth to Restrictive Layer\n    - Hydrologic Group\n    - Soil Depth\n    - etc.\n* Cons:\n  + 800m resolution\n  + Large data gaps (layer dependent)\n\n##### Alternative layers\n[gNATSGO (gridded National Soil Survey Geographic Database)](https://gee-community-catalog.org/projects/gnatsgo/)\n\n* Pros:\n  + Authoritative\n  + Source layer for value added products (including Soil Properties 800m)\n  + 10m resolution\n* Cons:\n  + Large data gaps across AZ\n  + 10m resolution\n\n[Polaris 30m Probabilistic Soil Properties US](https://gee-community-catalog.org/projects/polaris/)\n\n* Pros: \n  + Continuous data availability (no gaps)\n  + 30m resolution\n* Cons: \n  + Fewer data layers\n  + Probabalistic model (increased uncertainty)\n\n\n\n## Conclusion {#sec-conclusions}\n\n## References {.unnumbered}\n\n",
