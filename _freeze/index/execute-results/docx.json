This analysis seeks to identify regions across AZ which are boadly suitable for aquifer recharge projects as a general template for more focuse analysis.\nplain-language-summary: |\n  Identifying regions in AZ where surface water can be stored long-term as ground water.\nkey-points:\n  #| TBD\ndate: last-modified\nbibliography: references.bib\n#| citation:\n  #| container-title: Earth and Space Science\nnumber-sections: true\njupyter: python3\n---\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Introduction\n\n## Data & Methods {#sec-data-methods}\n**These methods and data layers are preliminary and subject to change**\n### Elevation\n#### DEM\nElevation and elevation derivatives from 30-m NASA SRTM. USGS 3-DEM (10m) product not suitable for full study area analysis due to (1) the large area of missing data in Mexico, and (2), the excessively high spatial resolution (massively increasing computational requirements).\n\nSRTM elevation sinks filled prior to calculating slope and aspect.\n\n**Should elevation be directly used in the suitability analysis?**\n\n#### Slope\nSlope derived from hydrologically conditioned (filled) 30-m SRTM layer using quadratic surface function and a fixed 30-m neighborhood. Slope measured in Â°.\n\n> Higher slopes are less suitable because thinning is both more expensive and more precipitation will end up as runoff.\n\nSlope classified from 1-10 using a **continuous function** in ArcPro Suitability Mapper.\n\nPamameter|Setting\n:-------:|:-------------:\nFunction|[MSSSmall](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/tool-reference/spatial-analyst/the-transformation-functions-available-for-rescale-by-function.htm#ESRI_SECTION1_6C2FDA23D8094B8F99DBF3DF5E176B1D)\nMean multiplyer|1\nSddv multiplier|2\nLower threshold|0\nValue below threshold|0\nUpper threshold|90\nValue above threshold|0\nInvert function|FALSE\nSave transformed dataset|TRUE\nOutput|Transformed_SRTM_slope\n\n![Slope suitability mapper rescale transformation setup.](images/SuitabilityAnalysis_Transformations/Slope.png)\n\n#### Aspect\nAspect calculated as with slope. Aspect reference point at N. Pole.\n\n> Aspect has a large impact on solar radiation.\n\n> Closer to 0 or 360 is desired, low suitability scores for closeness.\n\nAspect classified from 1-10 using a **continuous function** in ArcPro Suitability Mapper.\n\nPamameter|Setting\n:-------:|:-------------:\nFunction|[Near](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/tool-reference/spatial-analyst/the-transformation-functions-available-for-rescale-by-function.htm#ESRI_SECTION1_A7FC2FC126CD4A41974C8D3F5E0F8FD6)\nMid Point|180\nPoint spread|0.0011049638968393428 (default)\nLower threshold|-1 (flat)\nValue below threshold|0\nUpper threshold|360\nValue above threshold|0\nInvert function|TRUE\nSave transformed dataset|TRUE\nOutput|Transformed_SRTM_aspect\n![Aspect suitability mapper rescale transformation setup.](images/SuitabilityAnalysis_Transformations/Aspect.png)\n\n### Precipitation\nPRISM normals, 800m resolution. Annual precipitation.\n\n> Mean annual precipitation must be higher than 500mm 1990 - 2020\n\nPrecipitation classified from 1-10 using a **continuous function** in ArcPro Suitability Mapper.\n\nNOTE: The logistic growth function may also be a good choice for this dataset.
