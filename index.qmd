abstract: |
  Aquifer recharge can be either passive or active, and is implemented in a variety of ways. This analysis seeks to identify regions across AZ which are boadly suitable for aquifer recharge projects as a general template for more focuse analysis.

  Identifying regions in AZ where surface water can be stored long-term as ground water.

## Introduction

## Data & Methods {#sec-data-methods}
**These methods and data layers are preliminary and subject to change**
### Elevation
#### DEM
Elevation and elevation derivatives from 30-m NASA SRTM. USGS 3-DEM (10m) product not suitable for full study area analysis due to (1) the large area of missing data in Mexico, and (2), the excessively high spatial resolution (massively increasing computational requirements).

SRTM elevation sinks filled prior to calculating slope and aspect.

**Should elevation be directly used in the suitability analysis?**

#### Slope
Slope derived from hydrologically conditioned (filled) 30-m SRTM layer using quadratic surface function and a fixed 30-m neighborhood. Slope measured in Â°.

> Higher slopes are less suitable because thinning is both more expensive and more precipitation will end up as runoff.

Slope classified from 1-10 using a **continuous function** in ArcPro Suitability Mapper.

#### Aspect
Aspect calculated as with slope. Aspect reference point at N. Pole.

> Aspect has a large impact on solar radiation.

> Closer to 0 or 360 is desired, low suitability scores for closeness.

Aspect classified from 1-10 using a **continuous function** in ArcPro Suitability Mapper.

### Precipitation
PRISM normals, 800m resolution. Annual precipitation.

> Mean annual precipitation must be higher than 500mm 1990 - 2020

Precipitation classified from 1-10 using a **continuous function** in ArcPro Suitability Mapper.

**Classification Schema**

| Class | Count (pixels) | Text | Value |
|:-----:|:-----:|:---------------------:|:-----:|
|A|62559472|Group A soils consist of deep, well drained sands or gravelly sands with high infiltration and low runoff rates.|10|
|B|76665198|Group B soils consist of deep well drained soils with a moderately fine to moderately coarse texture and a moderate rate of infiltration and runoff.|10|
|C|88491710|Group C consists of soils with a layer that impedes the downward movement of water or fine textured soils and a slow rate of infiltration.|8|
|D|155095790|Group D consists of soils with a very slow infiltration rate and high runoff potential. This group is composed of clays that have a high shrink-swell potential, soils with a high water table, soils that have a clay pan or clay layer at or near the surface, and soils that are shallow over nearly impervious material.|3|
|A/D|43192|Group A/D soils naturally have a very slow infiltration rate due to a high water table but will have high infiltration and low runoff rates if drained.|??|
|B/D|18456|Group B/D soils naturally have a very slow infiltration rate due to a high water table but will have a moderate rate of infiltration and runoff if drained.|??|
